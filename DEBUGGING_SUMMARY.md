# Debugging Summary - Multi-Modal Research System

## Issues Found and Fixes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Logging System Issues
**Problem:** Log files were created but remained empty (0 bytes) because of buffering.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `multi_modal_rag/logging_config.py` to flush log entries immediately after writing.

**Result:** Logs now write to `logs/research_system_TIMESTAMP.log` in real-time.

### 2. ‚úÖ YouTube Collection Broken (FIXED)
**Problems Found:**
1. Error: `TypeError: post() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`
   - Cause: `youtube-search-python` library incompatible with newer `httpx`

2. Error: `HTTPError: HTTP Error 400: Bad Request`
   - Cause: `pytube` is completely broken (YouTube changed their API)
   - pytube hasn't been updated and can't fetch video metadata anymore

**Fix Applied:**
- **Completely replaced `pytube` and `youtube-search-python` with `yt-dlp`**
- `yt-dlp` is actively maintained and handles YouTube API changes automatically
- Added `yt-dlp==2024.3.10` to `requirements.txt`
- Rewrote both `search_youtube_lectures()` and `collect_video_metadata()` methods

**Action Required:**
```bash
pip install yt-dlp==2024.3.10
```

**Then restart the application** (Ctrl+C and run `python main.py` again)

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Podcast Collection - Potential Issues
**Warning:** `pydub` cannot find `ffmpeg` or `avconv`

**Impact:** Audio transcription with Whisper will fail if podcast audio needs format conversion.

**Fix Required:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# Windows
# Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Search Functionality - Working (returns 0 results as expected)
**Status:** OpenSearch connected successfully. Search is working but returns 0 results.

**Reason:** The collected videos haven't been **indexed** into OpenSearch yet.

**What's Happening:**
- YouTube collection works ‚úÖ (5 videos collected successfully)
- Videos are collected but not indexed ‚ö†Ô∏è (was the issue)
- Search returns 0 results because index is empty ‚úÖ (expected behavior)

**Fix Applied:**
- Data collection now **automatically indexes** collected items into OpenSearch
- Added `_index_data()` and `_format_document()` methods to handle indexing
- Added `handle_reindex()` method for the "Reindex All Data" button
- Connected the reindex button to its handler
- Added comprehensive logging to track indexing progress

**After restart:** When you collect data, it will be automatically indexed and searchable!

### 5. ‚úÖ Gemini API Model Error - FIXED
**Problem:**
- Error: `404 models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta`
- The model name `gemini-1.5-flash` doesn't exist in the free tier

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed to `gemini-pro` (free model for text)
- Changed to `gemini-pro-vision` (free model for image analysis in PDF processor)
- Updated all three files:
  - `research_orchestrator.py`
  - `pdf_processor.py`
  - `video_processor.py`

**Action Required:** Restart the application to load the new model names.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install yt-dlp
```bash
pip install yt-dlp==2024.3.10
```

### Step 2: Install ffmpeg (for podcast audio processing)
```bash
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

### Step 3: Restart the application
Stop the current running instance (Ctrl+C) and run:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 4: Test YouTube Collection
Try collecting YouTube videos through the UI to verify the fix works.

### Step 5: Check Logs
After testing, review the log file:
```bash
# Find the latest log file
ls -lt logs/

# View the log
tail -f logs/research_system_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```

---

## Log File Locations

All logs are written to: `logs/research_system_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

The application displays the log file path when it starts:
```
üìù Logs are being written to: logs/research_system_20251002_221805.log
```

## What to Look For in Logs

### YouTube Collection
- Search: Look for "Starting YouTube search for query"
- Success: "Successfully collected N videos"
- Errors: "Error searching YouTube lectures"

### Podcast Collection
- RSS Parsing: "Collecting podcast episodes from RSS"
- Audio Download: "Downloading audio from"
- Transcription: "Transcribing audio (this may take several minutes)"
- Errors: "Error collecting podcast episodes" or "Error transcribing audio"

### Search Operations
- Query: "Processing research query"
- Results: "Retrieved N search results"
- LLM Response: "Generated response"
- Errors: "Error processing query" or "Cannot search - OpenSearch not connected"

## Known Limitations

1. **YouTube Search:** Now uses yt-dlp which is more reliable but slightly slower than the old library
2. **Podcast Transcription:** Requires Whisper model download (happens automatically on first use)
3. **Search:** Requires data to be indexed first - papers, videos, or podcasts must be collected before searching

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Install yt-dlp: `pip install yt-dlp==2024.3.10`
- [ ] Install ffmpeg (if using podcast features)
- [ ] Restart application
- [ ] Try YouTube collection with query "Machine Learning"
- [ ] Try searching (if you have indexed data)
- [ ] Check log file for detailed error information
- [ ] Report any new errors with log file excerpts
