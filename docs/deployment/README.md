## Deployment Path Recommendations

### For Developers

1. Start with **[Local Deployment](local.md)** to understand the system
2. Move to **[Docker Deployment](docker.md)** for consistent environments
3. Review **[OpenSearch Setup](opensearch.md)** for search optimization

### For DevOps Engineers

1. Review **[Docker Deployment](docker.md)** for containerization
2. Study **[OpenSearch Setup](opensearch.md)** for infrastructure
3. Implement **[Production Considerations](production.md)** for deployment

### For System Architects

1. Read **[Production Considerations](production.md)** for architecture
2. Reference **[OpenSearch Setup](opensearch.md)** for cluster design
3. Use **[Docker Deployment](docker.md)** for orchestration

### For Quick Start

1. Follow **[Local Deployment](local.md)** to get running in 10 minutes
2. Use Docker commands from **[Docker Deployment](docker.md)** for single-command deployment
